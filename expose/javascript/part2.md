1.) It will print "3" because the variable "i" used in
the for-statement is incremented up to 3 and because it
was declared using "var", it can be used anywhere in the code.
2.) It will store the discounted price of the last price and print
it. In this case, because the last price is 300, then it will print 150.
The reason is because everytime the loop runs, it makes a new "discountedprice"
variable and stores a different value in it each time. So, the last one is the
variable that remains and is the one that gets printed out.
3.) It will print "150" to the console because it will print the last final
price of the list. The last value it stores is "150" so the the statement
at line 13 will print its last value.
4.) It will print 50, 100, 150. In other words, the discounted prices
of the given prices. Also, because the variable "discounted" was declared
with "var", then it can be changed and used anywhere in the code.
5.) It will print an error because the variable "i" was declared using let.
Therefore, it can not be called outside of it's scope, which is inside of the
for-loop.
6.) It will cause an error because "discountedPrice" was declared using let. Therefore,
it can not be called outside of it's scope, which is inside of the for-loop.
7.) It will print 150 because it is the last value put into "finalPrice". It is
also still in the scope of the variable.
8.) It will print 50, 100, 150. In other words, the discounted prices of the given
prices. Also, because the variable "discounted" was called within its scope.
9.) It will cause an error because the variable "i" was declared using let and it
therefore it can not be called outside of its scope, which is inside of the for-loop.
10.) It will print 3 because the lenth of the given array is 3 and because it was
called within its scope, which is anywhere inside of the function.
11.) It will return an error because the variable "discounted" is being changed
in the for-loop, which you are not allowed to change the value of a const variable.
